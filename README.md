# Infinite Ammo

What else do you want me to put here? It does what the title says it does.

# Why?
The original infinite ammo mods now no longer work.

As of Patch 4, Melonloader 0.5.7 does not work.

This is a Melonloader 0.6.1 infinite ammo mod.

# Quest?

**No.**

Not until Lemonloader gets updated. Don't bug the Lemon dev about it either.

ML 0.6.1 doesn't work on Quest, and it won't for a while.
